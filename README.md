Do you know that an average computer user blinks 7 times in front of the computer? Well, that might seem a lot, but the average human should blink 20 times per minute!. This script helps me blink from time to time! ;)

## Installing

This script uses [Free Desktop Notification Client](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html) and should work out-of-the-box in any distro that ships with X.11 or Wayland. It runs as cron job that is scheduled via crontab.

Also, if you have `paplay` command available (Pulse Audio), it shall play a notification sound.

```bash
./INSTALL
```
